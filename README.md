# Fake Face Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake faces using a combination of image processing techniques, distance metrics, and validation methods. The implementation involves generating a dataset, processing images, and using metrics to validate the authenticity of face images. This work is designed to support applications in media forensics and synthetic media detection.

## Features

- **Image Dataset Handling**: Supports processing real and fake face datasets.
- **Validation Technique**: Employs distance metrics to validate authenticity based on image similarity.
- **Batch Processing**: Tests performance with different batch sizes to evaluate loss trends.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

Install the requirements using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib

Project Structure

    Dataset: A dataset folder (data) containing subfolders for real and fake images.
    Notebook: Jupyter Notebook (Fake_Face_Detection.ipynb) contains code for preprocessing, validation, and visualization.
    Validation Function: A custom function to test the detection accuracy using random samples.

Usage

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake-face-detection.git
cd fake-face-detection

Place your dataset in the data folder:

data/
├── real/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
└── fake/
    ├── image1.jpg
    ├── image2.jpg
    └── ...

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook Fake_Face_Detection.ipynb

    Run the notebook cells sequentially to process the dataset, validate results, and visualize metrics.

Results

The notebook evaluates detection accuracy across varying batch sizes. Below is a sample plot of Batch Size vs Loss:

Future Enhancements

    Model Integration: Add pre-trained models like CNNs for enhanced detection.
    Advanced Metrics: Incorporate metrics like SSIM for improved validation.
    Larger Dataset Support: Optimize the pipeline for larger datasets.
