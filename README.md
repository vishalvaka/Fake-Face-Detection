# Fake Face Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake faces using a combination of image processing techniques, distance metrics, and validation methods. The implementation involves generating a dataset, processing images, and using metrics to validate the authenticity of face images. This work is designed to support applications in media forensics and synthetic media detection.

## Features

- **Image Dataset Handling**: Supports processing real and fake face datasets.
- **Validation Technique**: Employs distance metrics to validate authenticity based on image similarity.
- **Batch Processing**: Tests performance with different batch sizes to evaluate loss trends.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

Install the requirements using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

- **Dataset**: A dataset folder (`data`) containing subfolders for `real` and `fake` images.
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (`Fake_Face_Detection.ipynb`) contains code for preprocessing, validation, and visualization.
- **Validation Function**: A custom function to test the detection accuracy using random samples.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake-face-detection.git
   cd fake-face-detection
   ```

2. Place your dataset in the `data` folder:
   ```
   data/
   ├── real/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── fake/
       ├── image1.jpg
       ├── image2.jpg
       └── ...
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fake_Face_Detection.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to process the dataset, validate results, and visualize metrics.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Integration**: Add pre-trained models like CNNs for enhanced detection.
- **Advanced Metrics**: Incorporate metrics like SSIM for improved validation.
- **Larger Dataset Support**: Optimize the pipeline for larger datasets.
