# Fake Face Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake faces using a combination of image processing techniques, distance metrics, and validation methods. The implementation involves generating a dataset, processing images, and using metrics to validate the authenticity of face images. This work is designed to support applications in media forensics and synthetic media detection.

## Features

- **Image Dataset Handling**: Supports processing real and fake face datasets.
- **Validation Technique**: Employs distance metrics to validate authenticity based on image similarity.
- **Batch Processing**: Tests performance with different batch sizes to evaluate loss trends.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`

Install the requirements using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
